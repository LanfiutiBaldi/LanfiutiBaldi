Hi! I'm Giacomo Lanfiuti Baldi, a Ph.D student in Statistical Sciences (Demographic curriculum) at "La Sapienza" Univeristy of Rome. 
I have a background in statistics and graduated with a master's degree in Data Analyst, but my greatest interest is in demographic research.
Combining my career studies and my research interests, I works in the field of Statistical Demography.
Statistical Demography addresses demographic issues by exploiting simple or sophisticated statistical modelling. 
In particular, Giacomo I focus on modelling and forecasting mortality and population gaps in mortality.
